This Challenge project aims to use a deep learning model to predict which organisations that received funding from Alphabet Soup had a successful outcome.

This analysis requires TensorFlow and is best run through Google Colaboratory. Correct performance in VS Code environment is not guaranteed.

The analysis has used four different modifications of the TF Keras model. The models are saved as .keras files as .h5 is now deprecated.
